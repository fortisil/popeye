# Popeye CLI – Open Source Manifesto

## Why Popeye Exists

Popeye was built out of frustration.

Not with coding itself — but with everything that blocks coding:

- endless project setup
- boilerplate before logic
- tooling debates before value
- unfinished ideas piling up in repos

We believe ideas should turn into working software faster.
And modern AI makes that possible — if used responsibly, transparently, and collaboratively.

**Popeye exists to remove friction between intention and execution.**

## What Popeye Is (and Is Not)

**Popeye is:**

- an AI-powered CLI that turns plain-English ideas into real projects
- a system that plans, reviews, builds, tests, and fixes code automatically
- a developer tool focused on production-ready outcomes
- an open, inspectable, hackable codebase

**Popeye is not:**

- a black-box "magic" code generator
- a replacement for developers
- a closed SaaS disguised as open source
- a shortcut that hides complexity instead of managing it

We believe developers stay in control.
AI is a collaborator — not an oracle.

## Core Principles

### 1. Open by Default

Popeye is:

- open source
- publicly auditable
- forkable
- extensible

If it runs on your machine, you should be able to:

- read it
- modify it
- improve it
- disagree with it

No hidden logic. No locked workflows.

### 2. Humans Own the Vision, AI Does the Heavy Lifting

Popeye assumes:

- humans define what should be built
- AI helps decide how to build it
- humans always have the final say

You describe intent.
Popeye handles the grind.

### 3. Opinions Are Explicit, Not Hidden

Every tool has opinions.

Popeye:

- encodes its assumptions openly
- documents why decisions are made
- welcomes debate and alternative approaches

If you disagree with a default:

- change it
- propose an improvement
- fork it

Open source thrives on disagreement done well.

### 4. Quality Over Demos

Popeye prioritizes:

- clean project structure
- testable code
- predictable builds
- real developer workflows

This is not about generating screenshots.
It's about generating maintainable software.

### 5. Community > Perfection

Popeye will evolve in public.

That means:

- some rough edges
- ongoing refactors
- design discussions in the open

We value:

- contributors over polish
- feedback over silence
- progress over purity

## How You Can Contribute

You don't need to be an AI expert to help.

You can:

- improve prompts or planning logic
- add frontend or backend templates
- extend language or framework support
- improve test strategies
- tighten docs and examples
- report bugs or weird behavior
- challenge architectural decisions

If you've ever thought:

> "I wish dev tools worked this way instead…"

Popeye wants your opinion.

## The Long-Term Vision

We believe the future of software looks like this:

- ideas → specs → code → tests → running apps
- fewer abandoned repos
- fewer "weekend projects" that never start
- more people shipping things they actually care about

Popeye is one step in that direction.

Not the final answer — but an open experiment.

## An Invitation

If this resonates with you:

- Star the repo
- Try it
- Break it
- Fix it
- Open discussions
- Build with us

Open source doesn't grow because code is perfect.
It grows because people feel welcome to shape it.

**Welcome aboard.**
